ML + Django = Mango.

This is a web application, yes, a web app which has been made entirely in Python. It consists of machine learning model created by my friend, which is used to predict names of Pokemon using their base stats (HP, Attack, Sp. Attack, Speed etc) as inputs and vice versa (predicting stats of Pokemon using name).

This is an effort to make Pokemon selection in competitive Pokemon battling easy and possibly helping the smogon community.
